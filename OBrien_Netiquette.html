			  <h2>Make sure to always have G Fuel and hot chip next to you at all times.</h2>
		  <p>If you look at professional gamers you will notice that they are all shaking while sitting at their desk. This may come from the unprescribed adderall that they take before the tournaments but they all wear G Fuel sponsored clothing so it must be G Fuel.</p>
		  <p>If you don’t enjoy G Fuel you can always just eat hot chip. It is important to eat your Cheese Puffs before your games to get you pumped for the epic dub! Make sure to not wipe your hand off before touching the keyboard again because when you are fragging out, there is no time to waste.</p>
			<h2>Don’t be toxic towards other players… unless you need to be.</h2>
		  <p>Everybody hates being yelled at by that one guy in voice chat for making the wrong callout or just being bad at the game. You need to remember that at one point you were just as bad as the people you were playing with. This is why you need to remember to stay calm in the face of a n00b.</p>
		  <p>There are some times that it is acceptable to get mad at others in your game. The God himself Ninja has had some moments when he gets mad at others like the time he said, “The frick you said to me you little poop!”(in a much harsher tone). If he can do it that means that it is ok for you to get mad.</p>
			  <h2>Never Solo Queue</h2>
		  <p>The worst thing that you can do is go into a game without any of your buddies. There is a high chance that someone you will queue with is going to be really bad at the game. When you queue with your friends, you know who you are going to be playing with.</p>
			  <h2>Make sure to get the Epic Victory Royale!</h2>
		  <p>There is no better feeling than winning a game of Fortnite with your buddies. You get to post a picture of #1 Victory Royale to your snapchat story and have all of your friends be impressed. When you come to school the next day your friends will always want to be in your go4 squad after they hear how good you are at getting the dubs!</p>
